Question 1:

short: 
Provide shorter size of length of integers. The value ranges from -32,768 to 32,767.

int: 
Represent an integer, usually the natural size of the integers on the host machine. The value ranges from -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

float:
Represent single-precision floating point. The value ranges from 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38.

double:
Represent double-precision floating point. The value ranges from 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308. 


Question 2:

The result would be 3.000000
The reason is that the float would chop off the decimal part of the result and just return back an integer.

Question 3:

i = 1, j = 1, x = 0, y = 1

Becasue before the program reach to the printf function, the value of i has been incremented from 0 to 1 and so did j. However, for x the incrementation was done after we set it equals to i which is initially 0. But for y, the incrementation was recognized ahead and then it was passed along to j which is 0, returning a value of 1.
